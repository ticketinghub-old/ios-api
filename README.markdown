## TicketingHub-ios

A library for interacting with the TicketingHub
[Developer API](https://www.ticketinghub.com/api) from an iOS device.

### Dependencies

* AFNetworking (MIT Licence), added as a submodule to the repository already

These frameworks needed to be added to the project:

* System Configuration
* MobileCoreServices
* Security

It's a good idea to add these lines to the project's pch file:

    @import SystemConfiguration;
    @import MobileCoreServices;
    @import Security;
